Lighthouse Labs - Project lotide (A project inspired by the Lodash library although a much smaller and simpler collection of functions that operate on data, namely Arrays and Objects.  Lotide was created to fulfill one of several project requirements of Lighthouse Lab's full-stack web development bootcamps.)
