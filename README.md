# lotide
Lighthouse Labs - Project lotide (small library containing various function created to operate on Objects and Arrays - JavaScript)

The lotide project is a project inspired by the Lodash library.  Although being a much smaller and simpler collection of functions relative to Lotide, the focus of the two libraries is similar as they contain functions that operate on data, namely Arrays and Objects.  

This lotide project was created as one in a series of projects required to be submitted for evaluation in order to complete ighthouse Lab's full-stack web development bootcamps.
